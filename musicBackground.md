## Here is some background required for understanding how the jazznet dataset was created

The dataset is based on the notes of a standard 8-octave (88-key) piano. The main notes of a piano (and most other stringed instruments) are typically represented using 7 letters: $A, B, C, D, E, F, G$ (the white keys on a piano). The notes between the main notes (i.e., the black keys on the piano) are described as _sharp_ $(\sharp)$ to the immediately preceding note, or _flat_ $(\flat)$ to the immediately succeeding note. For example, the note/black key between C and D is called $C\sharp$ or $D\flat$ (the naming is usually contextual to the reference note, but details of the context are not important here). An _octave_ is the interval between one musical pitch and another half or double its frequency. For example, the middle C on a piano (or C4---C in the fourth octave) has a frequency of 261.63 Hz (commonly approximated as 256 Hz), the next C (or C5) has a frequency of 523.25 Hz, and the prior C (C3) has a frequency of 130.81 Hz. From each note to its octave, there are 12 'half steps' (commonly called _semitones_) or 6 'full steps' (commonly called _tones_). For example, the notes from a C to its octave are represented as: $C, C\sharp, D, E\flat, E, F, F\sharp, G, A\flat, A, B\flat, B$. We use these popular notation (i.e., $C\sharp$ vs. $D\flat$ or $E\flat$ vs. $D\sharp$) in the dataset. On an 8-octave piano, the 12 notes are repeated approximately 7 times with different frequencies. Musical patterns can be played on all of these notes.

The dataset consists of four _types_ of fundamental musical patterns: _chords, arpeggios, scales_ and _chord progressions_. A chord is a harmonic set of pitches or frequencies consisting of multiple notes that are played/heard simultaneously. The most basic forms of chords are _dyads_ and _triads_. Dyads (also known as _intervals_) are two notes that are played together, while triads are three notes that are played together. The notes in both dyads and triads can be arranged in different forms, called _inversions_, an important feature that adds to the diversity of improvisational music. The figure below illustrates inversions using the C major triad in its root, first, and second inversions.

The chords in all keys follow the same pattern for the inversions. A dyad has only one inversion, a triad has two, and a chord with more than three notes has additional inversions; e.g., a four-note chord (_tetrad_) has three inversions. _Arpeggios_ are simply chords whose notes are played separately, one after the other. Like chords, arpeggios can be played in multiple inversions based on the number of notes in the arpeggio.

A _scale_ is a set of notes ordered by the frequency of the notes within the scale. For example, the C major scale---also known as the C _Ionian mode_---comprises all the main notes (white notes on the piano) in one octave starting from C (i.e., $C, D, E, F, G, A, B$). The distance (tone vs. semitone) between the notes is a pattern that remains consistent on any other key. The most common kinds of scales in music are _diatonic_ scales, which contain seven notes per octave, wherein the distance between each successive note is determined by the scale's _mode_. For example, the Ionian mode is structured as the root, two whole steps, one half step, and three whole steps; the _Aeolian mode_ (also known as the natural minor scale) is structured as the root, one whole step, one half step, and four whole steps; and so on. Like chords and arpeggios, the structures in the scales remain consistent in every key, and we leverage these patterns in the creation of jazznet. 

Finally, one of the first and most important things a new jazz pianist must learn are the common chord _progressions_. Chord progressions are successions of chords that form the foundation of music. Most jazz piano improvisation is performed using a few common progressions in different variations. Progressions are usually represented using Roman numerals, with small letters for minor chords and capital letters for major chords. For example, one of the most common chord progressions in the key of C major is: _C major-A minor-D minor-G major_, represented as _I-vi-ii-V_. This allows the progression's representation to be divorced from the underlying specific key.
